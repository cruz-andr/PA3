'''

In this file you will write the model definition for a feedforward neural network.

Please only complete the model definition and do not include any training code.

The model should be a feedforward neural network, that accepts 784 inputs (each image is 28x28, and is flattened for input to the network)
and the output size is 10. Whether you need to normalize outputs using softmax depends on your choice of loss function.

PyTorch documentation is available at https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html, and will specify whether a given loss funciton
requires normalized outputs or not.
